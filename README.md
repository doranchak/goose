Welcome to GOOSE, the Grand Oligarchy Of Synthetic English.

Way back in 1992, I wrote this program in BASIC with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100317145809/http://www.unc.edu/~jmspille/blog.shtml">Jerry</a> and Keeley in spastic adolescent fits of nerdy boredom.  It's basically a glorified mad-lib generator, with sentence structures and word substitutions designed specifically to amuse us teenage boys.  We used the old IBM PC in Sr. Marroquin's Spanish class.  Why he let us get away with such nerdy behavior, I'll never know.  But GOOSE now lives on thanks to the magic of translating the old BASIC code (GOOSE.BAS) to JavaScript.
